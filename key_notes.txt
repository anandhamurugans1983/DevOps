1. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) -- Eclips tool
2. Version control System:
	Distributed VCS: Git/GitHub, Mercurial. - full copy including version will be available in local machin
	Centralized VCS: CVS, Perforce, SVN(subversion).  - version maintained in central server
Git is written in C language.

DevOps: 

waterfall : 
1st software development life cycle model.
lenear and sequential 
--requirment gathering and analysis 
-- design
-- implement ( code and compile unit test , package build)
-- test ( E2E testing )
-- deploy ( deploy in prod server )
-- maintanance
limitation:
--Not suitable for projects where the requirements are at a moderate to high risk of changing.
-- not good model for complex and object oriented projects
-- difficult to make code change, if requirement changes in testing phase.

Agile :
continuous design, build, testing

WaterFall
Analyze --> plan --> Desing --> Build --> Test --> Deploy
 
Agile:
Analysis --> plan --> ( continuous itertion of Design, Build, Test ) --> Deploy

limitations:

Dev Team wants change -- Operation team wants Stability

DevOps ::

Software development Startergy/Methodology which bridges the gap between dev side and ops side of the company.
